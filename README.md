# Junction 2019

### Track: Secure the Future
### Challenge: Security Awereness for Kids

### Solution: IoK - Internet of Kids

Project realized for Junction 2019 and targeting Ericsson's challenge on raising cybersecurity awareness in kids


In this increasingly connected world, there are more than 4 billion unique internet users. Out of these, a third are estimated to be underage users. Moreover, 54 million of users are children under the age of 13 years old. Thus, a large number of users are really young and might not have the tools and knowledge to coop with the ever-evolving online environment.
So, If you’re a parent, then you know how daunting it can be to explain cybersecurity to a child when their young minds are still grasping the concept of the internet. I’m sure most just want to play games online, watch videos, or chat with their friends on social media.
As your child begins to learn more about the internet and this new world to explore, we believe it is also important to inform them of ways to stay safe on the internet.
The main focus of the Internet of Kids (IoK) plug-in is to instruct young generations towards a more conscious and wise use of the internet. Therefore, safeguarding the identity and sensible data of both the children and their closest loved ones. While browsing, the main threads that kids could encounter are ransomware, suspicious links, phishing, password sharing, and cyber-bullying. To provide young users with the knowledge on how to avoid malicious traps, the plug-in challenges them with fake threats to test their level of awareness. For instance, while the child is browsing for a page, he is redirected to another page that presents a fake request of access as shown in Figure[]. Here, the kid has to pay attention not to trigger any dangerous link or not to fill in any password or sensible data request. In case he fails to avoid the malicious trap or he succeeds, the child is then redirected to a page in which it gives the result of the test and warned with some advice on what it could have happened and some explanation regarding the threat. Then, the choice of playing a minigame where it can practice skills like remembering slightly more complex passwords. Also, the fake threat could be presented more often in case the kid is weak at tackling those occurrences. The difficulty of these games could be increased depending upon the age of the user.
Moreover, in order to make the interface with the child more appealable, an avatar called IoKid (see Figure []) will be used to interact with him, providing guidelines during the minigames and while surfing the web.
Thanks to these features, the plug-in reliefs the parents from the heavy and stressful duty to explain and monitor the online usage of their kids, especially if they are not confident and familiar with the internet environment. This add-on will provide parents with easy to interpret statistics of the history and online security level of the child. In addition, the parents' interface will allow to easily blacklist different pre-sets of websites and also add others when desired.
