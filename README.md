# Junction 2019

### Track: Secure the Future
### Challenge: Security Awereness for Kids

### Solution: IoK - Internet of Kids

Project realized for Junction 2019 targeting Ericsson's challenge on raising cybersecurity awareness among kids.


In this increasingly connected world, there are more than 4 billion unique Internet users. A third of these are estimated to be underaged. Moreover, 54 million of users are children under the age of 13 years old. Therefore, a large number of users are really young and might not have the tools and knowledge to cope with the ever-evolving online environment.
If you are a parent, you probably know how daunting it can be to explain cybersecurity to children when their young minds are still grasping the concept of the Internet. Most of the time, they just want to have fun playing online games, watch some videos, or chat with their friends on social media. As your child begins to explore and learn more about the Internet, we strongly believe that it is important to inform them of ways to stay safe in this new world.
The main focus of the Internet of Kids (IoK) plug-in is to instruct young generations towards a more conscious and wise use of the Internet. Therefore, safeguarding the identity and sensible data of both the children and their closest loved ones is our purpose. 
While browsing, the main threats that kids may encounter are ransomware, suspicious links, phishing, dubious friendship requests, password sharing, and cyber-bullying. To provide young users with the knowledge on how to avoid malicious traps, the plug-in challenges them with simulated threats to test their level of awareness. For instance, while the child is browsing through a page, he might be redirected to another page that presents a fake login form (see Figure[]). Here, the kid must pay attention to not trigger any dangerous link or to not fill in any password or sensible data request. 
The child is then redirected to a page in which he is given the result relative to the actions he took. He will be delicately warned about the possible dangers he might have faced and provided with some advice on how to avoid unpleasant situations. Afterwards, he also has the possibility to play a minigame which allows practicing some skills such as remembering slightly more complex passwords. Also, the fake threat could be presented more often in case the kid is weak at tackling those occurrences. The difficulty of these games could be increased depending upon the age of the user.
Moreover, in order to make the interface more appealing for the children, an avatar called IoKid (see Figure []) is used to interact with him, providing guidelines during the minigames and while surfing the web.
Thanks to these features, the plug-in reliefs the parents from the heavy and stressful duty to explain and monitor the online usage of their kids, especially if they are not confident and familiar with the Internet environment. In addition to this, the add-on will provide parents with easy to interpret statistics of the history and online security level of the child. From the parents' dashboard is eventually possible to easily blacklist different pre-sets of websites and possibly add others when desired.
